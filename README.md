Financial Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard:
This project analyzes global sales, profit, and profit margins across multiple countries, product segments, and product lines. The goal of the analysis is to understand sales patterns, profitability trends, and performance differences across regions and segments using Excel and Power BI. 
Tools Used: 
•	Excel – data cleaning, formatting, calculated fields, pivot analysis
•	Power BI – interactive dashboard and data visualization 
Project Overview: 
I started by cleaning the raw dataset in Excel: 
•	removed currency symbols and formatting 
•	fixed date fields 
•	created new fields (Profit Margin %, helper date columns) 
•	built pivot tables to understand monthly, country-wise, and segment-wise trends. After the data was cleaned, I imported it into Power BI. I built a one-page dashboard that highlights sales, profit, and margin performance across the dataset. 
Key Insights:
•	Total sales: $118.73M, profit: $16.89M, with stable performance across 2013–2014.
•	Profit margin stayed consistent at ~27.9% across all countries and segments.
•	USA, Canada, and France generated the highest sales.
•	Government and Small Business segments contributed most of the revenue.
•	Monthly sales show normal fluctuations with a strong finish in late 2014.
